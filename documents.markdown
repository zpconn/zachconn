The following are some mathematical documents I’ve prepared for various reasons that could be of general interest.

* [The Christoffel-Schwarz Formula](https://www.dropbox.com/s/56u1udlcgrui3ma/christoffel-schwarz.pdf) --  this short article provides a completely rigorous and self-contained proof of the Christoffel-Schwarz formula, which gives an explicit integral representation of a conformal mapping from the unit disc onto an arbitrary polygon.

* [Distances in the Hyperbolic Plane](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tfi5v825pytfhnw/hyperbolic-distances.pdf) -- this article derives several formulas for computing distances in the hyperbolic plane, and it then uses these formulas to prove the Pythagorean theorem in hyperbolic geometry.

* [The Sylvester-Gallai Theorem](https://www.dropbox.com/s/91xrflmrm9duwce/sylvester-gallai.pdf) -- a short article developing a remarkable proof of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem from classical geometry using Euler’s formula for connected planar graphs.

* [Periodid Billiard Orbits in Convex Polytopes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/trvn079bd4k1w52/periodic-billiard-orbits.pdf) -- a LaTeX-beamer presentation that I gave with Nell and Ray at the Penn State 2010 Math REU. This is a completely self-contained presentation introducing the most basic ideas in the theory of mathematical billiards and outlining some of our research that summer.

* [Topology, Groups, and Knots](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ks3l7pbyz8m8wom/topology-groups-knots.pdf) -- a light-weight and self-contained introduction to the most basic ideas of knot theory, including the foundational material from group theory and topology. It culminates with the significant and non-trivial Wirtinger presentation of the knot group.

* [Linking Numbers in 2-fold Branched Covers of the 3-sphere](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m5sdpf0sy60gyr5/linking-numbers.pdf) -- a poster covering some minor research I did on how linking numbers lift to two-fold branched covers of the three-sphere.
