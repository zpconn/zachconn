### Work Experience

* **FlightAware**:
	Lead software developer. *June 2013 to present*.

	-  Direct management responsibility for the backend flight tracking team, which develops and maintains the company's core flight tracking decision engine. Drive the vision and implementation of the company's flight tracking technology while focusing on leading and growing the team.

	- Spearheaded the design and implementation of a major rearchitecture of the core flight tracking infrastructure from a serial processor into a highly performant distributed system, increasing the company's data processing capacity by a factor of 10x.

	- Act in rotating role as release engineer: oversee and perform the daily production code push; review all code going into production; analyze new SQL queries; work with individual developers to avert problems; produce company-wide weekly development report.

* **Rice University**:
	Research intern. Studied metric and differential geometry in the context of classic complex analysis under Prof. Frank Jones. *Summer 2012*.

* **Rice University**: TA. Ran large help sessions for Frank Jones's Honors Multivariable Calculus sequence. *August 2011 to May 2012*.

* **Cornell University**: Research intern. Developed new theory of de Rham cohomology on post-critically finite fractals under mentorship of Prof. Robert Strichartz; results published in *Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis*. *Summer 2011*.

* **Pensylvania State University**: Research intern. Led the development and implementation in C of novel computer algorithms to determine the existence of omnihedral orbits in convex polytopes. *Summer 2010*.

* **The Idea Works, Inc.**: Intern. Developed semantic networks for the flagship product SAGrader, an online automated essay grading service powered by unique artificial intelligence strategies. Adapted the program for use in large introductory psychology courses at Park University; my work is still in use today. *November 2008 to December 2009*.

### Conference Presentations

* **23rd Annual Tcl/Tk Conference**, *17 November 2016*, *Houston, TX*.

	- Presented my work on **hyperfeed**, the highly concurrent and parallelized flight tracking engine powering FlightAware. [(PDF version of preprint.)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pxjld10b853sfk5/Hyperfeed.pdf?dl=0)

### Research

* **[Hodge-de Rham Theory on Fractal Graphs and Fractals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1310)** (*Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis*).

	- *Abstract*: We present a new approach to the theory of k-forms on self-similar fractals. We work out the details for two examples, the standard Sierpinski gasket and the 3-dimensional Sierpinski gasket, but the method is expected to be effective for many PCF fractals and also infinitely ramified fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet Our approach is to construct k-forms and de Rham differential operators d and delta for a sequence of graphs approximating the fractal and then to pass to the limit with suitable renormalization, in imitation of Kigami's approach to constructing Laplacians on functions. One of our results is that our Laplacian on 0-forms is equal to Kigami's Laplacian on functions. We give explicit construction of harmonic 1-forms for our examples. We also prove that the measures on line segments provided by 1-forms are not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measures.

* **MASS Fest Conference, Pennsylvania State University**, *11-12 August 2010*.

	- "Periodic billiard orbits in convex polytopes" with Ray Navarete, Andre Kuney, and Nell Kroeger.

* **Rice University Undergraduate Research Symposium**, *16 April 2010*.

	- "Calculating linking numbers in two-fold branched covers in S^3" with Drew Moore.

### Education

* **Rice University**:
	BA, Mathematics. *May 2013*.

	Helped run and organize the Rice Math Tournament, a math competition for advanced high school students in the southern United States. Our competition coincides with, both in content and time, the Stanford Math Tournament.
* **Independent University of Moscow**:
	Participant in *Math in Moscow*, an advanced program in mathematics. Among eight students accepted internationally. *Fall 2010*.

### Awards and Honors

* First place, computer programming event, Missouri State University Pummill Math Relays. *2005, 2006, 2007, 2008*.
