### Work Experience

*	**FlightAware**:
	Software engineer. *June 2013 to present*.

	- Designed and implemented a predictive model for inferring future airport capacity and individual flight delays based on inclement weather. 

	- Implemented, from back-end to front-end, a feature-rich commenting system for photos on the site using a combination of JavaScript, Tcl, and SQL (backed by PostgreSQL).

	- Implemented an automated spam detector using artificial intelligence strategies such as naive Bayes classifiers. This generic system was written in Tcl and, thanks to its generic design, allowed us to automatically and intelligently filter spam from disparate commenting and discussion systems on the site.

	- Implemented a linear partitioning algorithm in JavaScript to achieve an optimal photo layout a la Google Images and Flickr. Also added infinite scrolling to photo galleries with automatically updating URLs using HTML5's pushstate capabilities.

	- Helped develop framework for processing millions of ADS-B positions a day and collecting novel statistics to display to users. Developed a number of data visualizations so users can track their contributions and improve their reception.

	- Created a feature-rich game for crowdsourcing photo tagging.

	- Developed framework for caching hourly flight delay statistics which are often quoted in the media, especially during holiday seasons.

*	**Rice University**:
	Research intern. Studied metric and differential geometry in the context of classic complex analysis under Prof. Frank Jones. *Summer 2012*.

*	**Rice University**: TA. Ran large help sessions for Frank Jones's Honor Multivariable Calculus sequence. *August 2011 to May 2012*.

*	**Cornell University**: Research intern. Developed new theory of de Rham cohomology on post-critically finite fractals under mentorship of Prof. Robert Strichartz; results published in *Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis*. *Summer 2011*.

*	**Pensylvania State University**: Research intern. Led the development and implementation in C of novel computer algorithms to determine the existence of omnihedral orbits in convex polytopes. *Summer 2010*.

*	**The Idea Works, Inc.**: Intern. Developed semantic networks for the flagship product SAGrader, an online automated essay grading service powered by unique artificial intelligence strategies. Adapted the program for use in large introductory psychology courses at Park University; my work is still in use today. *November 2008 to December 2009*.

### Publications

*	**Hodge-de Rham Theory on Fractal Graphs and Fractals** (*Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis*).

	*Abstract*: We present a new approach to the theory of k-forms on self-similar fractals. We work out the details for two examples, the standard Sierpinski gasket and the 3-dimensional Sierpinski gasket, but the method is expected to be effective for many PCF fractals and also infinitely ramified fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet Our approach is to construct k-forms and de Rham differential operators d and delta for a sequence of graphs approximating the fractal and then to pass to the limit with suitable renormalization, in imitation of Kigami's approach to constructing Laplacians on functions. One of our results is that our Laplacian on 0-forms is equal to Kigami's Laplacian on functions. We give explicit construction of harmonic 1-forms for our examples. We also prove that the measures on line segments provided by 1-forms are not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measures.

### Education

*	**Rice University**:
	BA, Mathematics. *May 2013*.

	Helped run and organize the Rice Math Tournament, a math competition for advanced high school students in the southern United States. Our competition coincides with, both in content and time, the Stanford Math Tournament.
*	**Independent University of Moscow**:
	Participant in *Math in Moscow*, an advanced program in mathematics. Among eight students accepted internationally. *Fall 2010*.

### Awards and Honors

*	First place, computer programming event, Missouri State University Pummill Math Relays. *2005, 2006, 2007, 2008*.

	- The competition involved developing artificial intelligence for virtual robots which would fight each other in a simulated two-dimensional arena (using the Robocode platform).

*	Missouri Bright Flight Scholar (99th percentile ACT score).

*	University of Missouri Excellence Award.

*	University of Missouri Engineering Achievement Award.

* 	NSF grant for the Pennsylvania State University Mathematics REU.

*	NSF grant for the Cornell University Mathematics REU.

*	VIGRE grant at Rice University for Summer 2012.
