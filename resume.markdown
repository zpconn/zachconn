### Work Experience

* **FlightAware**:
	Director of Engineering. *June 2013 to present*.

	- Founded and run the Aviation Insight organization with multiple fully staffed teams focusing on core flight tracking infrastructure, the quality of all flight and surface tracking results company-wide, and machine learning for predictive problems. Responsible for hiring, staff retention, people management, high-level architectural planning, fundamental research, and business leadership and vision.

	- Accountable for the quality, performance, and reliability of all flight and surface tracking results.

	- Oversaw design and implementation of three generations of the core flight tracking decision engine, including the transition from a serial single-threaded processor to a highly performant distributed system. Personally responsible for a 10x increase in the company's flight data processing capacity.

	- Pioneered the use of distributed machine learning and deep learning at FlightAware in particular and the aviation industry in general. Conceived, incubated, helped implement, and now oversee the [FlightAware Foresight](https://flightaware.com/commercial/foresight/) product suite.

	- Oversaw design and implementation of multiple production machine learning systems for computing runway landing times, gate arrival times, and more. We train thousands of models on hundreds of thousands of CPU cores using hundreds of millions of historical examples per airport. These real-time estimates are now in operational use by the largest airports and airlines in the world and impact the majority of the US air traveling public.

* **Rice University**:
	Research intern. Studied metric and differential geometry in the context of classic complex analysis under Prof. Frank Jones. *Summer 2012*.

* **Rice University**: TA. Ran large help sessions for Frank Jones's Honors Multivariable Calculus sequence. *August 2011 to May 2012*.

* **Cornell University**: Research intern. Developed new theory of de Rham cohomology on post-critically finite fractals under mentorship of Prof. Robert Strichartz; results published in *Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis*. *Summer 2011*.

* **Pensylvania State University**: Research intern. Led the development and implementation in C of novel computer algorithms to determine the existence of omnihedral orbits in convex polytopes. *Summer 2010*.

* **The Idea Works, Inc.**: Intern. Developed semantic networks for the flagship product SAGrader, an online automated essay grading service powered by unique artificial intelligence strategies. Adapted the program for use in large introductory psychology courses at Park University; my work is still in use today. *November 2008 to December 2009*.

### Conference Presentations

* **23rd Annual Tcl/Tk Conference**, *17 November 2016*, *Houston, TX*.

	- Presented my work on **hyperfeed**, the highly concurrent and parallelized flight tracking engine powering FlightAware. [(PDF version of preprint.)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pxjld10b853sfk5/Hyperfeed.pdf?dl=0)

### Research

* **[Hodge-de Rham Theory on Fractal Graphs and Fractals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1310)** (*Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis*).

	- *Abstract*: We present a new approach to the theory of k-forms on self-similar fractals. We work out the details for two examples, the standard Sierpinski gasket and the 3-dimensional Sierpinski gasket, but the method is expected to be effective for many PCF fractals and also infinitely ramified fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet Our approach is to construct k-forms and de Rham differential operators d and delta for a sequence of graphs approximating the fractal and then to pass to the limit with suitable renormalization, in imitation of Kigami's approach to constructing Laplacians on functions. One of our results is that our Laplacian on 0-forms is equal to Kigami's Laplacian on functions. We give explicit construction of harmonic 1-forms for our examples. We also prove that the measures on line segments provided by 1-forms are not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measures.

* **MASS Fest Conference, Pennsylvania State University**, *11-12 August 2010*.

### Education

* **Rice University**:
	BA, Mathematics. *May 2013*.

	Helped run and organize the Rice Math Tournament, a math competition for advanced high school students in the southern United States. Our competition coincides with, both in content and time, the Stanford Math Tournament.
* **Independent University of Moscow**:
	Participant in *Math in Moscow*, an advanced program in mathematics. Among eight students accepted internationally. *Fall 2010*.
