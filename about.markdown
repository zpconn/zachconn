title: About
---

I have a degree in mathematics from Rice University and have had a life-long passion for programming. As an undergraduate I published some research in the area of analysis on fractals at Cornell University with Robert Strichartz. I also had a lot of fun studying mathematics in Russia as part of the [Math in Moscow](https://mathinmoscow.org/) program.

Leaving academia behind, I am currently Director of Engineering at [FlightAware](https://www.flightaware.com) in Houston, TX.
