title: About
---

I have a degree in mathematics from Rice University and have had a life-long passion for programming. As an undergraduate I did some research in the area of analysis on fractals at Cornell University with Robert Strichartz; along with two other undergraduates we ended up writing a paper on a new formulation of de Rham cohomology on fractals, and you can read the preprint [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1310).

Leaving academia behind, I'm now working as a software developer at [FlightAware](http://www.flightaware.com).
