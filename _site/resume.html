<ul>
<li><p><strong>FlightAware</strong>: Software engineer. <em>June 2013 to present</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented worldwide ADS-B coverage visualization using D3 involving spherical Delaunay triangulations and alpha shapes.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed extensive web interface for visualizing ADS-B data contributed by a large worldwide network of hundreds of volunteers, including Coxcomb radial charts to show coverage distribution. This has led to hundreds of volunteers feeding data to FlightAware. Used flot and Raphael.js.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed framework for caching hourly flight delay statistics which are often quoted in the media (CBS, CNN, etc.), especially during holiday seasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Created a powerful web-based Tcl profiler which will automatically profile all function calls, thereby reconstructing the full call tree created during page generation. This tool is now used by all FlightAware developers and has led to optimizations that cut many critical page generation times in half.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented novel backtracking algorithm to deduce mapping tables for reversing airline callsign disambiguation. This is a critical component in maintaining the accuracy of flight tracking results on the website.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed machine learning algorithms for the prediction of future airport capacity based on past records of inclement weather.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed and implemented a major revision of the photos interface (serving over half a million photos in total), including a new optimal jigsaw layout (a la Google Images and Flickr), infinite scrolling, and a feature-rich commenting system.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed and implemented an intelligent site-wide spam filtering system based on conventional Bayesian classifiers (inspired by Paul Graham’s “A Plan for Spam”).</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote an interpreter to convert dense TAF weather forecasts into friendly English-language hour-by-hour breakdowns. This allows the millions of users who can’t read TAF reports to understand an airport’s weather breakdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Help mentor and lead summer development interns.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rice University</strong>: Research intern. Studied metric and differential geometry in the context of classic complex analysis under Prof. Frank Jones. <em>Summer 2012</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rice University</strong>: TA. Ran large help sessions for Frank Jones’s Honors Multivariable Calculus sequence. <em>August 2011 to May 2012</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cornell University</strong>: Research intern. Developed new theory of de Rham cohomology on post-critically finite fractals under mentorship of Prof. Robert Strichartz; results published in <em>Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis</em>. <em>Summer 2011</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pensylvania State University</strong>: Research intern. Led the development and implementation in C of novel computer algorithms to determine the existence of omnihedral orbits in convex polytopes. <em>Summer 2010</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Idea Works, Inc.</strong>: Intern. Developed semantic networks for the flagship product SAGrader, an online automated essay grading service powered by unique artificial intelligence strategies. Adapted the program for use in large introductory psychology courses at Park University; my work is still in use today. <em>November 2008 to December 2009</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hodge-de Rham Theory on Fractal Graphs and Fractals</strong> (<em>Communications in Pure and Applied Analysis</em>).</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: We present a new approach to the theory of k-forms on self-similar fractals. We work out the details for two examples, the standard Sierpinski gasket and the 3-dimensional Sierpinski gasket, but the method is expected to be effective for many PCF fractals and also infinitely ramified fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet Our approach is to construct k-forms and de Rham differential operators d and delta for a sequence of graphs approximating the fractal and then to pass to the limit with suitable renormalization, in imitation of Kigami’s approach to constructing Laplacians on functions. One of our results is that our Laplacian on 0-forms is equal to Kigami’s Laplacian on functions. We give explicit construction of harmonic 1-forms for our examples. We also prove that the measures on line segments provided by 1-forms are not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measures.</p></li>
